# OpenASSA 

openASSA is an initiative by members of the Actuarial Society of South Africa to develop open-source actuarial software. The project is still very new and the design and goals are currently being discussed.

If you're interested in joining the discussion, please join our [Slack channel](https://communityinviter.com/apps/openassa/openassa).

Please note **this is work in progress for OpenASSA.**

It is an attempt, using Julia, to expand on OpenASSA's vision.
